# 🌀 genai_agentic_chaos

A personal sandbox for exploring the frontier of **Agentic Workflows**, autonomous LLM chains, and the fascinating "chaos" that emerges when GenAI agents start talking to each other.

## 🧪 Project Intent

This repository serves as a living laboratory for experimentation and learning. The focus is on moving beyond simple prompting into the world of:

- **Autonomous Agents:** Building loops where AI plans its own steps.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Experimenting with frameworks like CrewAI, LangGraph, or AutoGen.
- **Tool Use:** Teaching models to interact with the real world via APIs and local scripts.
- **Self-Correction:** Exploring "reflection" patterns where agents critique and fix their own outputs.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (The Toolkit)

- **Primary Language:** Python
- **Models:** GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and local Llama 3 experiments.
- **Frameworks:** (e.g., LangChain / CrewAI / PydanticAI)
- **Infrastructure:** Vector DBs, environment-based secrets, and structured logging.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Scratchpad for quick API tests and prompt engineering.
- `agents/`: Core logic for specific agent personas and behaviors.
- `tools/`: Custom Python functions provided to agents for execution.
- `experiments/`: Documented "chaos" sessions—what worked, what failed, and why.

## 🚀 Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/genai_agentic_chaos.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/genai_agentic_chaos.git)
